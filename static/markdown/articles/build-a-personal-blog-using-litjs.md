title: Build a personal blog using litjs
description: The expeirence of buiding a static site as a personal blog using a less popular frontend library, litjs, considering the necessary components and available solutions, would not have done this if I was not trying to introduce it to the work. The result is not as good as some built by nextjs/nuxtjs/sveltekit, however, one would find it interesting, by re-thinking how are the frontend frameworks being like what we see.
